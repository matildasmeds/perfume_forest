== About

PerfumeForest is a tiny catalogue of perfumes and olfatory notes. You can 'like' perfumes that you already know you like.
The original idea was to create a recommendation engine, based on likes, but I don't have the interest to do that currently.  
The application stores likes in the browser's local storage. 

Ruby on Rails 4.2, Thin webserver, Postgresql, Haml, vanilla CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Test suite is powered by RSpec, Capybara, Selenium and Chrome driver.
