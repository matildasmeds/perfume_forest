== About

PerfumeForest is a *currently small* online catalogue of perfumes and corresponding olfatory notes. You can 'like' perfumes that you already know you like, and the app will *soon enough* recommend you other perfumes that could interest you from the catalogue. 

Visit the application --> https://perfume-forest.herokuapp.com

The name is derived from so called random forest algorithms, which sparked the idea for this application initially. The application currently stores likes in the browser's local storage. No login is required, hence there is no authentication mechanism in place.

Technical stack includes Ruby on Rails 4.2, Thin webserver, Postgresql, Haml for templating, vanilla CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to implement the client side 'like perfumes' functionality. Test suite is powered by RSpec, Capybara, Selenium and Chrome driver.

Feedback is very welcome, and so are contributions, if you feel interested in the project.
